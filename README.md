# chess-opening-popularity
chess-opening-explorer is a python app that maps the popularity of an opening, or set of openings, over a period of time.

## Insipiration and Example
Online chess traffic has nearly doubled since the release of Netflix's The Queen's Gambit on Oct. 23, 2020. In the final match played by the main character, Beth Harmon, she opens with the Queen's Gambit (1. d4 d5 2. c4).  This project was built to investigate the popularity of the Queen's Gambit opening since the release of the Netflix miniseries.
